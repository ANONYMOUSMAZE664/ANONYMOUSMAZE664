## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Barirah**, a first-year Computer Science student trying to figure out how all this tech stuff actually works.

I like **building things**, breaking them, and then learning why they broke.  

If I get a new idea, chances are I’ll try it — whether it’s **a small web app, a robot, or some weird experiment**.

Right now, my main tech stack is **C, Java**, but I’m dabbling in **Arduino, React, and basic robotics**. My favorite tools are **VS Code, Arduino IDE, and Google (it’s basically my IDE)**.  

Some ongoing projects:  
- **Floui** — a companion robot I’m building while learning robotics and embedded systems  
- Various mini experiments — mostly messy, sometimes working  

I’ve got a bunch of small repos, but my “serious learning” is mostly private for now.  

**Fun Facts:**  
* I’m exploring everything from software to hardware  
* My GitHub contribution graph looks like my mood swings  
* Coffee is optional, curiosity is mandatory  
* **Hobbies:** coding, tinkering with electronics, thinking up weird project ideas, and **playing Valorant**

*Currently learning by doing. One project at a time.*
